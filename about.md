		<p>I come to therapy with a variety of experiences, including a life in the arts and years in the customer service industry.</p>

		<p>I hold a Masterâ€™s Degree in Marriage and Family Therapy from Auburn University, one of the top programs in the country and am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in the state of Illinois.</p>

		<p>I have provided treatment to individuals and families with a range of backgrounds and mental health diagnoses at a Chicago community mental health agency for the past few years.</p>

		<p>I find this work very rewarding and relish the experience of watching people build their self-understanding and confidence in treatment, then going out primed to tackle life and its inevitable challenges.</p>
